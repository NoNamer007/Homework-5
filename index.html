        <h1> Hi!</h1>
        <p> I love to code on scratch.mit.edu. The reason I like to code is because I like video games, and when I make them, I get to make them however I want. I like to code on scratch is because it has easy interface, UI, etc. It is also a free website, where I can publish my games so that anyone can see them! <br><br> My scratch account: scratch.mit.edu/users/no_namer007/. My sister's scratch account: scratch.mit.edu/users/Mr_sinister007/.</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>I live in USA and I love coding. I like to make games the most but I also no how to make websites. I make games on scratch.mit.edu (my username is no_namer007). I like scratch because you can share your games with other people, you can interact with other scratchers (other scratch coders) and scratch is easy to use and make games. When I grow up I want to be a game developer and make different types of racing/car games (I love cars).</p>
